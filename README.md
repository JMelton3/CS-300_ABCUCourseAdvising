# Project2_ABCUCourseAdvising_JohnMelton



- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  - The program we developed is attempting to read from a csv file and sorting the courses.
  - Before developing the code, we are tasked with analyzing the runtime of different data collection types and then making a recommendation.
  - After communicating our recommendation, I then created a command line version of the requested program.

- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  - After breaking down the individual functions required for the program, we then want to develop the pseudocode for the program.
  - Next, I was able to make a recommendation and create the program.

- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  - The biggest challenge to me was working with different data collections.
  - Once I got used to the differing syntax, I was able to see the similarities and work with each type with minimal issues.



- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  - I think this course helped me realize how and why we could implement different datatypes in a program.
  - Before this class I wouldnâ€™t have considered runtime when selecting a collection type, but now I would consider the pros and cons of each before implementing the into a system.

- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - After this project I am more comfortable working with different collection types and will be able to communicate their importance clearly.
